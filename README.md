Hello everyone,

My name is Yusuf, also known as archescyber. Today, instead of simply presenting an ordinary GitHub profile, I want to share some of my thoughts about myself and the vast world of the internet.

Cybersecurity is an endless ocean for those who dare to explore it. However, diving into its depths requires time, dedication, and a constant desire to learn. Always remember, the internet is not as innocent as it may seem; every light casts a shadow. Therefore, question everything you encounter and prioritize protecting yourself in the online world.

For those who wish to step into the realm of cybersecurity, here’s my advice: this field is far more than cloning a few projects. It’s a space for passionate, curious, and ethical individuals. To preserve both your integrity and the reputation of this field, don’t be a "lamer," and don’t encourage others to take that path either.

Lastly, remember that cybersecurity is not just a profession; it’s also a responsibility. Use your knowledge wisely to grow as an individual and contribute positively to those around you.

Best regards and warm wishes.
